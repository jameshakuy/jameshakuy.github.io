# Introduction
If you think about it, AI is still a relatively new field, yet there are already so many use cases across many industries. One of which is in education, where AI is used to teach students, and students utilize AI to teach themselves. Although there weren't many instances in which the professor used AI to teach us this semester, there were a few times he instructed us to ask AI during class to look up definitions and such. For the other case of utilizing AI, many students in the class, including myself, used a chatbot to generate code for us. Whether it was for educational purposes or to simply copy and paste code, there is no doubt that at some point, we all used it (Most students didn't raise their hands when the professor asked whether they attempted to solve the WODs without using AI). I used ChatGPT, Gemini, and Claude throughout the semester, and the reason why I switched between these options is that new models were being released and benchmarks were being broken by different companies. 

# Personal Experience with AI
1. Experience WODs e.g. E18: For this WOD, I asked ChatGPT "Can you list possible functional programming methods that can be used to implement this function?". In this case, I found AI to be useful as it compiled information from many sources into an organized output, and knowing what functions to use helped me formulate how I should approach the problem. Note that I didn't straight up ask for the solution.

2. In-class Practice WODs. In laulima, it doesn't distinguish between "WODs" and "Practice WODs" so I'm not really too sure which one is which. I'll use the ko-hana-react WOD, for example. I remember asking the AI "Can you center and align the text so that it is centered?". I had trouble with styling.

3. In-class WODs (UI Design (Basics)): For this WOD, I decided not to use AI because of how simple the WOD was. I believe students need to study some minimal amount so that they feel comfortable completing WODs like this one without using AI at all. If you had to use AI on this WOD, then you probably copied and pasted your way through this semester.

4. Essays (This essay): I plan not to use AI for this essay as it heavily focuses on my experiences. Although, actually, I might scan it at the very end for a grammar check. Otherwise, the content of the essay is too personal for AI to be able to complete it.

5. Final project: I used AI on several issues, mostly on concepts I was not familiar with. For example, I was tasked with the AI work, and I didn't know how to fetch the data stored in the database for my Python code to use. "How do you fetch data stored in a Postgres database via a React form and parse it using tokenization so that my AI will be able to use it as input data?"

6. Learning a concept / tutorial: I use AI all the time to learn new concepts. Adding on to the above example, I asked AI how to deploy Python backend code. "How can I deploy my Python backend code on Vercel so that the system that works locally will also work when deployed?". I found out that the Python backend must be deployed separately on a service like Heroku or Render. Then the front end on Vercel must point to Render as well as Render pointing at the database hosted on Vercel.

7. Answering a question in class or in Discord: Most of the time, I didn't use AI to answer questions. In our class debate, for example, all of the information I used in my argument was found through personal research online.

8. Asking or answering a smart-question: Did not participate in this at all, I believe.

9. Coding example e.g. “give an example of using Underscore .pluck”: I've used AI for many functional programming methods. For example, "Can you explain .map in functional programming".

10. Explaining code: A lot of my coding knowledge comes from prompting GPT. I would find myself using it as a search engine most of the time. So, for example, say I explain code without using AI. But most of my knowledge comes from AI (that can also easily be found on the internet). Will this be considered using AI? I didn't use AI when the code was being explained, but my knowledge bank is mainly based on AI. hmm.

11. Writing code: Definitely yes, I would bet everyone in our class generated code at least once during this semester. This example is vague but an example would be "Can you show me how to create a simple Navbar in React and style it using React-bootstrap?".

12. Documenting code: Yes, I've used AI to document my code. I wouldn't use it for all, but for example, I often forget how to document code, so I ask, "Can you document these x functions? Include function parameters and descriptions of what it does?". Then I'll follow the guideline and document the rest myself.

13: Quality assurance e.g. “What’s wrong with this code <code here>” or “Fix the ESLint errors in <code here>”. I usually copy and paste all relevant code with the error and ask, "Here is my code and the error I am getting, can you troubleshoot this?".

Other uses in ICS 314 not listed: I often repetitively use a singular AI chat for each respective topic. So in this case, I have a chat for ICS 314, and because it has history context, I asked "Can you summarize important functional programming topics and give code snippets as examples?.
