*When you're going to change the world, don't ask for permission.*

I quoted this when I completed my most difficult project yet, the calculator app... This obviously did not happen, nor was it quoted by someone who exists. The quote comes from a fictional character named Viktor from a show that I really enjoyed named Arcane. In the lore, he is a scientist, a brilliant one who invented a technology that travels through the fourth dimension, time, and space. Now why did I bother sharing this? Part of me aspires to be a scientist, a researcher, and a historical benchmark, and his work as a scientist developed a whole new perspective for me.

Unfortunately, I am quite convinced that I'll not be able to solve the fourth dimension as he did but as a Computer Scientist and an aspiring Machine Learning Researcher/practitioner, I believe that I could change the world in the field of my interest.

Machine Learning is still relatively new. In fact, technology itself is relatively new concerning how long the Earth has existed. We have seen exponential growth in technology throughout the past century and with this rate, we can expect future projections of exponential growth as well. This suggests we have only touched the surface of what we are capable of developing and the fact that I could also contribute to the evolution of this planet excites me more than anything.

So what do I plan to accomplish in my mortal lifespan of a mere 100 years?

## In the context of programming

In the context of programming, this has always been true. The difficult problems have always been different, although changes in technology can change the landscape quite a bit. "Business" type applications are the things that come to mind for me. Those types of applications are usually coupled in some way with people ... and people are awfully hard to deal with!

Consider that one of the most popular content management systems is also considered the most horrible - Wordpress. But really, is there anything that fills that need? If it was so easy in the first place, where is the solution? Where's the magic CMS that is designed well enough that everyone hops on the boat to use it?

Some things are just difficult - building applications that humans use is hard, and will probably be hard for at least the near future.
