Throughout this semester, we had the priviledge to learn Software Engineering principles alongside tools to practice these principles. We had WODs and take home WODs to solidify our understanding of these tools and our final project allowed us to practice S.E. principles. Such principles includes Agile Project Development, Configuration Management, Design Patterns, and more! As much as I would love to talk about how my team and I followed these standards to complete our project, I will first define these terms to get you on pace.

# What is Agile Project Development?
Agile Project Development is a methodology that focuses on collaboration, iterative development, and flexibility in response to change. To achieve these traits, projects are broken down into small manageable chunks in a continuous manner, improving using feedback. You can see this as an abstract class where there are many practices that derives from it. A specific approach we learned and practiced in class is called Issue Driven Project Management. While it follows core Agile principles, this approach focuses on small issues/tasks that are assigned to invidivual members which are assigned and resolved independently which ensures accountability and progress tracking.

# What is Design Patterns?
Design patterns are reusable solutions to common software design problems. They provide a structured approach to designing software that enhances code maintainability, scalability, and extensibility. Design patterns for software projects like MVC (Model, View, Controller) offers a structure (blueprint/schema) on how to approach projects. There are also design patterns in code such as components in React where code are encapsulated and are able to be reused across the whole project.

# What is Configuration Management?
Configuration management is the pracitce of managing software versions, configuration, and dependencies. It is important for all team members to work on the same version so code written are compatible. Note that not all code are compatible with different versions! For example, a python code written in 3.9 may not be compatible with say 3.6. Another example is the use of Git to manage code versions. If one team member is working on an old version and implements their changes, it may not work with the current version everyone else is working on.

# What is Coding Standards?
Coding standards are a set of guidelines developers follow to ensure that code is readable, maintainable, and consistent. These standards include naming conventions, indentation, commenting practices, and function design principles. However, there is not one set and stones standard. Coding standards can differ from institutions, coding languages, organizations, companies, etc. It's important that you follow the standards enforced at your workplace.


Phew! Now that all definitions are made clear, I can finally share how we used these methodologies to complete our project in ease! To begin with, our coding standards were mainly enfored by linter which is a tool that analyzes source code for programmatic and stylistic errors. We also commented our code to make it easier for other members to understand it. Another tool we used ig called Git! Git is a version control system that tracks changes in files, which makes it easier for teams to work together. This is a tool used for configuration management practices. We also used npm which manages packages and dependencies so that the versions are consistent across all users. Now, throughout the duration of this project, we
