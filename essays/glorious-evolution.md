*When you're going to change the world, don't ask for permission.*

I quoted this when I completed my most difficult project yet, the calculator app... This obviously did not happen, nor was it quoted by someone who exists. The quote comes from a fictional character named Viktor from a show that I really enjoyed named Arcane. In the lore, he is a scientist, a brilliant one who invented a technology that travels through the fourth dimension, time, and space. Now why did I bother sharing this? Part of me aspires to be a scientist, a researcher, and a historical benchmark, and his work as a scientist developed a whole new perspective for me.

Unfortunately, I am quite convinced that I'll not be able to solve the fourth dimension as he did but as a Computer Scientist and an aspiring Machine Learning Researcher/practitioner, I believe that I could change the world in the field of my interest.

Machine Learning is still relatively new. In fact, technology itself is relatively new concerning how long the Earth has existed. We have seen exponential growth in technology throughout the past century and with this rate, we can expect future projections of exponential growth as well. This suggests we have only touched the surface of what we are capable of developing and the fact that I could also contribute to the evolution of this planet excites me more than anything.

So what do I plan to accomplish in my mortal lifespan of a mere 100 years?

## AI in theory

Artificial Intelligence is about to change everything how we live, work, and understand the world and I want to be part of pushing it forward. One thing that really excites me is the idea of using AI to accelerate scientific discovery. Imagine machines that can come up with and test ideas in physics, chemistry, or medicine on their own. Think about an AI that could simulate millions of chemical compounds in seconds, cutting down the years it takes to develop new drugs that save lives. Looking ahead, in 30 or 60 years, AI might not just help us solve problems—it could invent entirely new areas of science, things we can’t even wrap our heads around right now. I want to be in the thick of that, helping shape AI into a tool that unlocks knowledge we never thought possible.

## AI in Practice

Beyond pure research, I believe AI will improve human productivity in levels not comparable to today. Right now, AI is excellent at narrow tasks writing code, generating images, or predicting trends—but the future will see more general and adaptive intelligence. One of my goals is to develop AI systems that can learn, reason, and adapt in real-world scenarios, making them as versatile as human experts. Picture a world where AI can serve as a collaborative partner, helping engineers design complex systems, automating large-scale infrastructure projects, or even optimizing entire economies. The challenge is not just creating powerful AI but ensuring it aligns with human values and goals. If I can contribute even a fraction to the responsible and groundbreaking advancement of AI, I will have done my part in changing the world.
